# Picture/Video Timestamper

This application recursively scans a directory for images and videos, renaming files based on their date of creation.

Before using the application, ensure that `ffprobe` and `exiftool` are correctly installed and searchable on your system.

```sh
scoop install ffmpeg exiftool
```
